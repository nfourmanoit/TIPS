== DESCRIPTION ==

 TIPS Is a Pixel Simulation software, that is based on aXeSIM code(http://axe.stsci.edu/axesim/).

ToBeDeveloped
 
== PREREQUISITES ==

 The project have some dependencies.
 At the level of the C code it requires:
  * Cross-platform Make (CMake) v2.6.2+
  * GNU Make
  * GCC, or an alternative reasonably conformant C++ compiler.
  * HEASARC's CFITSIO library (http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/)
  * GNU GSL library, with CBLAS interface (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
  * WCSTools library (http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/wcstools/)

 At the level of the python scripting it requires:
  * PyFITS module (http://www.stsci.edu/institute/software_hardware/pyfits)
    Note : PyFITS is now deprecated in favor of astropy.io.fits (on-going).
  * AstroAsciiData module (http://www.stecf.org/software/PYTHONtools/astroasciidata/)
  * SciPy and NumPy modules (http://www.scipy.org/index.html)

== BUILDING AND INSTALLING  ==
 
 This project uses the CMake build system. However, we have conveniently provided wrappers in the form of a configure script and a Makefile so that the typical build invocation of "./configure" followed by "make" will work. Take care that the users of CMake may think that the top-level Makefile has been generated by CMake but it hasn't. If deleted, this Makefile can be regenerated with "./configure".
 For a list of all possible build targets, use the command "make help".

 The CMake targets are the following:
  * all (default) : build all the project targets (binairies,libraries,archives/. This don't include the API doc, nor the tests.
  * test : build the project tests.
  * check : launch the project tests.
  * doc/doxygen : build the project API documentation.
  * clean : cleanup the build.
  * disclean : cleanup the entire project, back to its distribution version

 To buid the project one should do:
  >cd build; cmake ..
 or equivalently (wrapper a la autoconf)
  >./configure

 Then to install the project
  > make; sudo make install
